# Reze

Reze is a library that aims to offer an interface for generating mazes for most
of the patterns.

# Algorithms used

- `Randomized DFS` for mazes with long corridors
- `Randomized Kruskal` for mazes with short corridors
- `Wilson's Algorithm` for mazes with unbiased structure.

(Still in progress) You could read more about the algorithms [here](https://mrazvan.dev/blogs/maze-generation.html).
